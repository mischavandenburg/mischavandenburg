# Mischa van den Burg

DevOps Engineer, Cloud Native Engineer, command line inhabitant. I work mainly with Linux, Azure, Kubernetes, Postgres and Python.

[I'm in love with my work](https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/jiro-sushi/) because there is always more to learn. After the day job ends, I continue my studies, and I share what I learn on my blog and public Zettelkasten:

## Things I've Built

### Kubernetes Homelab

My pride and joy. Enterprise grade security in my pantry with Talos Linux and FluxCD.

<https://github.com/mischavandenburg/homelab>

### Shelly

Dockerized Python program that listens for MQTT topics and places them in a PostgreSQL database

<https://github.com/mischavandenburg/shelly>

### Zettelkasten CLI

A bespoke CLI written in Python to help me create notes in my Zettelkasten from vim and the command line.

<https://github.com/mischavandenburg/zettelkasten-cli>

### Zettelkasten Tracker

An API to track the number of notes in my Zettelkasten in a Postgres database so I can query them with Grafana.

(I love databases).

## Microsoft Azure

I work as a Cloud Engineer in an Azure environment and I've decided to go all-in on Azure and focus on that ecosystem. My employer kindly supplied me with a monthly credit which I can use for learning, so I'm building up an Azure Lab which I'm documenting on my blog and YouTube channel.

## Python

Actively learning Python on an advanced level.

After a 1 year flirt with Go and learning the fundamentals, I have returned to Python. It's the language I have most experience with, and which feels most natural to me, currently.

I enjoy that I can use it for practically everything.

> “Once you decide on your occupation, you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That’s the secret of success and is the key to being regarded honorably.”
