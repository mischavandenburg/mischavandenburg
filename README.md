# Mischa van den Burg

DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, command line inhabitant.

[I'm in love with my work](https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/jiro-sushi/) because there is always more to learn. After the day job ends, I continue my studies, and I share what I learn on my blog and public Zettelkasten:

> “Once you decide on your occupation, you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That’s the secret of success and is the key to being regarded honorably.”
