## Things I've Built

### Kubernetes Homelab

My pride and joy. Enterprise grade security in my pantry with Talos Linux and FluxCD.

### Shelly

Dockerized Python program that listens for MQTT topics and places them in a PostgreSQL database

### Zettelkasten CLI

A bespoke CLI written in Python to help me create notes in my Zettelkasten from vim and the command line.

### Zettelkasten Tracker

An API to track the number of notes in my Zettelkasten in a Postgres database so I can query them with Grafana.

(I love databases).

## Microsoft Azure

I work as a Cloud Engineer in an Azure environment and I've decided to go all-in on Azure and focus on that ecosystem. My employer kindly supplied me with a monthly credit which I can use for learning, so I'm building up an Azure Lab which I'm documenting on my blog and YouTube channel.

## Python

Actively learning Python on an advanced level.

After a 1 year flirt with Go and learning the fundamentals, I have returned to Python. It's the language I have most experience with, and which feels most natural to me, currently.

I enjoy that I can use it for practically everything.
