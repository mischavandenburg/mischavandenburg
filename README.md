# Mischa van den Burg

DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, command line inhabitant. I work mainly with Azure and Kubernetes, and I'm learning Go in my free time.

[I'm in love with my work](https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/jiro-sushi/) because there is always more to learn. After the day job ends, I continue my studies, and I share what I learn on my blog and public Zettelkasten:

# Go

I'm learning Go because most of the Cloud Native technology is written in it. I want to gain a better understanding of how they work, and I want to be able to contribute to their development in the future. 

I'm working through several courses and books, and I'm gathering ideas for projects that I want to write.

Along the way I'll be posting the things I learn on my [blog and public Zettelkasten.](https://www.mischavandenburg.com)

I try to do some work on Exercism every day. You can follow my progress and see my solutions [here.](https://exercism.org/profiles/mischavandenburg)
